Here’s a basic structure for a GitHub repository that will help you create a simple website. The website will use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display some content and style. You can customize this to add your own features.

Let me create the initial structure:

Basic Website Repo
Files to Include in Your GitHub Repository
1. index.html
This is your main HTML file, already provided above. It contains the structure and content of your website.

2. styles.css
Create a styles.css file to style your website. Here's an example:

css
Copy
Edit
body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    line-height: 1.6;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    background-color: #f4f4f4;
    color: #333;
}

header {
    background: #333;
    color: #fff;
    padding: 1rem 0;
    text-align: center;
}

header nav ul {
    list-style: none;
    padding: 0;
}

header nav ul li {
    display: inline;
    margin: 0 15px;
}

header nav ul li a {
    color: #fff;
    text-decoration: none;
}

main {
    padding: 2rem;
}

footer {
    background: #333;
    color: #fff;
    text-align: center;
    padding: 1rem 0;
    position: fixed;
    width: 100%;
    bottom: 0;
}
3. script.js
Create a script.js file for any interactivity you want to add. Here’s a simple starter:

javascript
Copy
Edit
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
    console.log("Website is loaded and ready!");
});
Instructions to Publish on GitHub Pages
Create a Repository on GitHub:

Go to GitHub and create a new repository.
Name it something like my-basic-website.
Upload Your Files:

Upload the index.html, styles.css, and script.js files to your repository.
Enable GitHub Pages:

Go to the repository's Settings > Pages.
Under "Source," select the branch containing your index.html file (usually main) and click "Save."
Visit Your Site:

GitHub will provide a URL (e.g., https://username.github.io/my-basic-website/) to access your website.

Scrap all of that. Create me a basic landing page for an investment website showing a graph of historical 1 year return for 5 different portfolios of stocks and a section where you can select the amount of each portfolio you would like to buy

add a timer and a database to store your personal portfolio. when you hit submit, you need to wait 5 minutes before submitting again, and the total investments between the 5 portfolios should be limited to 5.

The landing page now includes a timer that enforces a 5-minute wait before resubmission, a total investment cap of 5 across all portfolios, and a mock database to store portfolio data. Let me know if additional adjustments are needed!

I’ve added a visible countdown timer that starts after a submission, showing the remaining wait time. Additionally, I included a portfolio summary table that updates dynamically with each submission. Let me know if you need further adjustments!
